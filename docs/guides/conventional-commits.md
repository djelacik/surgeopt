## üöÄ Using npm run commit

This project is set up with [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to help you write Conventional Commits easily.

- Instead of using `git commit -m "your message"`, run:

```
npm run commit
```

- This will launch an interactive prompt that guides you through the commit process:
  - **Type**: feat, fix, chore, etc.
  - **Scope**: What part of the code? (e.g. agent, ui)
  - **Description**: What you did

- The tool will generate a properly formatted commit message for you, such as:

```
feat(parser): add PDF parsing with PyMuPDF
```

**Benefits:**
- Ensures all commits follow the Conventional Commits standard
- Reduces mistakes and saves time
- Integrates with tools like Commitlint and semantic-release

## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Make a Commit

Instead of:
```
git commit -m "added rfp parser"
```

Use:
```
npm run commit
```

This will prompt you:
- Type: feat, fix, chore, etc.
- Scope: What part of the code? (e.g. agent, ui)
- Description: What you did

It will generate something like:

```
feat(parser): add PDF parsing with PyMuPDF
```
